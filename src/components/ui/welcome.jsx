            This however doesn't mean departure from the actual teaching and
            educating practices. The fundamental concept of the school is to
            reduce the generation gap in the entire field, by the time the
            students get mature and enter into the practical aspects of the
            life. LSCS is the new meaning to a new dimension of education
            pattern. LSCS is not just a school. It is a place where the
            children's learn more practically about body, mind world and
            scientific developments. All the basic concept of education is
            cocooned to capture the mantle of human philosophy and its
            existence. The school understands the importance of coeval maturity.
